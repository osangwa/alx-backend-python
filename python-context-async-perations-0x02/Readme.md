Key Features Demonstrated
Task 0:
Custom class-based context manager using __enter__ and __exit__

Automatic resource management (connection closing)

Safe database operations within with statement

Task 1:
Reusable context manager that accepts queries and parameters

Flexible design for different query executions

Proper error handling and resource cleanup

Task 2:
Asynchronous database operations with aiosqlite

Concurrent query execution using asyncio.gather()

Non-blocking I/O operations for better performance

Proper async/await syntax usage
